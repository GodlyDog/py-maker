## About
A python implementation of the basic Maker Protocol source code found in the [DSS repo](https://github.com/makerdao/dss). Due to the unconventional lexicon of the source code, the DSS repo sometimes suffers from a lack of accessibility. This Python implementation of the DSS library serves as a informational primer on the protocol, allowing prospective contributors to more easily become Maker contributors. Thus, this library is intended for educational purposes only, as an on-ramp resource into the Maker Protocol. 

This is currently a work-in-progress. We encourage anyone knowledgeable about the dss source code and interested in contributing to make a pull request.
